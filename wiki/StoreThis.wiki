#summary Introduction
= Introduction =

StoreThis backs up the current working
directory (or the directroy in which it was 
launched) to either a local disk or a remote 
server using rsync & ssh. 
 
On the destination server or disk, it creates 
both a mirror and timestamped backups of 
previous versions of all files.

The first time you run it, it will prompt for 
some configuration options, and if set up 
fingerprints (public ssh keys) for a remote 
backup if needed. Once configured, it runs 
promptless. 

This is particularly usefull for GUI client
machines (like MacOSX or Gnome), because you
can store a copy of the executable in every
directory you want backed up, and click it
whenever you want to back it up. You'll only
need to configure it once. 

But if you like, you can call it with command
line arguments instead of the mentioned config,
too.


= Configuration =

The configuration is stored on
a per-user basis: each user will have it's own
StoreThis settings. To reset the configuration,
delete the configuration folder.

 If you change the name of
the executable, it will look for a different
configuration; this way, one user can have
scripts for "Store2UsbDisk" and "Store2RemoteBackup",
for example.

The configuration is stored by default
in ~/Library/Application Support/StoreThis or
in ~/.StoreThis. If you change the name of the
executable, the name of these folders change
likewise.
